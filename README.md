Repository for AIE AI Assessment

The intention of Kuno was to be an isometric point and click real time strategy game similar to the likes of Commandoes or Desperadoes, but set in feudal Japan instead.

Copied repo from bitbucket to github.
Will include AIE bootstrap so that the whole thing works as a unit when pulled.
